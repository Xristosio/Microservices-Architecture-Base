# Microservices Architecture Structure

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture with a base code structure for creating and managing Dockerized services using Docker Compose. The services are built using both Node.js (Express.js) and Python (Flask), and they communicate via RESTful APIs and Apache Kafka.

## Overview

The system consists of 5 microservices:

- **3 services communicate via API** (RESTful APIs)
- **2 services communicate via Apache Kafka** for asynchronous message-based communication

Each service is Dockerized, and Docker Compose is used to manage and orchestrate the services. The goal is to create a flexible, scalable, and secure architecture where services can interact efficiently while being isolated in their respective containers.

## Features

- **Microservices** built using:
  - **Node.js (Express.js)** for the backend services
  - **Python (Flask)** for additional services
- **Dockerized Services**: Each service is encapsulated in a Docker container.
- **Docker Compose**: Used for orchestration, allowing you to easily manage all services together.
- **API Communication**: Services communicate via RESTful APIs.
- **Kafka Communication**: Some services communicate asynchronously using Apache Kafka.
- **Security Considerations**: The Docker Compose setup is configured to be secure.

## Services Architecture

The system is designed with the following services:

1. **Service A (Node.js)**: Handles the core application logic.
2. **Service B (Node.js)**: Handles additional tasks and communicates with Service A via API.
3. **Service C (Python)**: Handles data processing and communicates with Service B via API.
4. **Service D (Node.js)**: Implements Kafka-based communication with Service E.
5. **Service E (Python)**: Listens for messages from Service D via Kafka and processes them.

## TODO

- **Kubernetes Management**:  
  Manage the microservices architecture with Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling.

- **Async Code**:  
  Add asynchronous code to improve performance and scalability.

- **Threading Code**:  
  Implement threading for better concurrency and resource management.

- **Database Configurations**:  
  Configure MongoDB and PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

- **Kafka Brokers**:  
  Add Kafka brokers for improved message handling and scalability.

- **More Kafka Topics**:  
  Implement additional Kafka topics to support various business use cases.
